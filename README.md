# PathFinding
This an Image-target based Augmented Reality Application in which a character is detected on a image and the user can tap anywhere on the image target to move the character to the that particular position.

For Pathfinding I have used an AI Tool available in unity called as NavMesh which is a pathfinding AI tool for unity.
For the Image-Target Detection I have used Vuforia Augmented Reality SDK.
**Note**
I have Created two scenes and Two Apk Files in the Project.In the first one the character does not follow the road specified in the image.In the other one character follows the road specified in the image.
